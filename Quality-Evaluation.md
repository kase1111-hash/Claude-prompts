COMPREHENSIVE SOFTWARE PURPOSE & QUALITY EVALUATION

(Idea-Centric, Drift-Sensitive, Production-Grade)

FOUNDATIONAL DOCTRINE (READ FIRST)

This evaluation treats software as a vehicle for ideas, not merely behavior.

Core axioms:

Purpose precedes polish. A well-built implementation of the wrong idea is a failure.

The idea must survive the code. If the implementation were deleted and rewritten from the spec, the same concept should emerge.

Legibility is load-bearing. Code that obscures intent fails, even if correct.

Drift is debt. Any divergence from intent that is undocumented is a liability.

The README is the deed. It must stake the conceptual claim clearly enough to establish attribution and priority.

All subsequent criteria exist to serve these principles.
