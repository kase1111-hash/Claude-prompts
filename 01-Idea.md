# Step 01 — Idea

## Your Job

State the idea in one sentence. That's it.

## AI Instructions

When the user gives you an idea, generate a project README that contains:

1. **Project name** — derived from the idea, keep it short
2. **One-line description** — the idea restated clearly
3. **What it is** — 2-3 sentences expanding what this thing does from a user's perspective
4. **Why it exists** — the problem it solves or the experience it creates
5. **Who it's for** — the intended user or audience

### Rules

- Do NOT add technical details, stack choices, or implementation notes
- Do NOT add installation instructions, contributing guides, or boilerplate
- Keep the entire README under 150 words
- Write it as if explaining the project to someone who has never seen it
- The README becomes the input for the next step

### Output

A single `README.md` file in the project repo.

## Example

**Input:** "Create a game where you change lightbulbs"

**Output:**

```markdown
# Bulb Swap

A puzzle game about changing lightbulbs.

## What It Is

You're a maintenance worker in a building full of broken lights.
Each level is a room with bulbs that need replacing — but the
switches are wired wrong, the ladders are too short, and the
bulbs keep burning out.

## Why

Sometimes the simplest job becomes the hardest puzzle.

## Who It's For

Anyone who likes spatial puzzles and dry humor.
